After at least 6 months of effort (and interruptions... so many interruptions)
I have finally completed the complete rewrite of artifact -- including
rewriting the frontend to be in rust compiled into web assembly. [2.0 is
complete and you can download it here (for linux only
ATM](https://github.com/vitiral/artifact/releases))

This release spans a huge amount of effort. The TLDR version:
- I felt like I needed a cohesive CLI SDK and so I created the
  [ergo](https://github.com/rust-crates/ergo) crate. This included several
  other crates created by me:
  - [path_abs](https://github.com/vitiral/path_abs) for better path handling.
  - [std_prelude](https://github.com/vitiral/std_prelude) for glob importing what I need.
  - [termstyle](https://github.com/vitiral/termstyle) for cleaner terminal styles.
  - [taken](https://github.com/vitiral/taken) for taking ownership.
  - [stfu8](https://github.com/vitiral/stfu8) for serializing/deserializing
    arbitrary bytes that are "mostly" utf8 compliant (i.e. paths).
- I used [yew](https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew) for developing the frontend. I ended up
  contributing a fair amount to both yew and [stdweb](https://github.com/koute/stdweb) but
  these frameworks were _surprisingly stable_. I also made a few crates:
  - [jrpc](https://github.com/vitiral/jrpc): for easily creating JSON-RPC
    requests and handling responses.
  - [yew_simple](https://github.com/vitiral/yew_simple): a simpler (in my
    opinion) imlementation of several yew services. It is important to note
    that yew is flexible enough that this is even possible :)

What I ended up with is the first (to my knowledge) full stack application in
rust that is more than a toy. Artifact is a reasonably complex piece of software,
and rust delivers its promises of speed and stability even at the cutting edge of
the web.

## Why Rewrite Everything?
The first question is probly why I decided a complete rewrite was necessary.
There are two answers: for fun and because I initially wrote artifact when I
was just learning rust for the first time and it _showed_.

I wanted to write artifact "the right way" -- using standardized libraries.
But those libraries didn't really exist yet (or at least they weren't cohesive)
so I went about building ergo. It was my way of giving back to the fantastic rust
community :)

The other reasons to rewrite were:
- Speed: I wanted to make the implementation completely parallel, and I did.
  It is _blazingly_ fast now.
- Simplicity: the filesystem interface now has an API which acts like a CRUD
  database. You simply give it a list of operations (create/modify/delete) and
  it makes sure they are valid and consistent and performs them. This made
  implementing the CLI and Server layers trivial, as they could both use this
  simple interface.
- New Features: I added several new features that the old library made
  difficult to add and test.
  - Sub Artifacts: you can add sub-artifacts using `[[.subart]]` syntax in the
    text of any artifact, making it possible to split up the definition
    of how to implement the artifact in source code. This also includes
    test subarts (`[[.tst-subart]]`).
  - Markdown format: the default way to specify artifacts is now using
    an extended form of commonmark markdown.
  - The docs (including the Simple Quality book) are now distributed directly
    with the web app.

## How was WASM / yew?
Rewriting the frontend in rust using yew (and compiling to webassembly) was
truly fun and exciting. There was definitely a few areas that needed
improvement; and being willing to contribute to fix your own issues was
_critical_ with the ecosystem where it is at now -- but the responsiveness of
the rust developers has never ceased to amaze me.

Probably the most amazing thing about writing your whole stack in a single
langauge is code reuse. I have a single crate, `artifact-ser` with the
serialization datatypes and logic that can be used anywhere in the stack.
This allows me to implement code once and use it anywhere -- a benefit
that can seriously not be overstated!


# Conclusion
I love rust, it is definitely my favorite language at the moment. Writing
a full stack application in pure rust has been an amazing experience.

The highlights however are definitely my interactions with the community. After
my [Rust and the Great CLI
Awakening](https://vitiral.github.io/2018/01/17/rust2018-and-the-great-cli-awakening.htm)
blog post I was invited to be on the [CLI Working
Group](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/cli-wg). Unfortunately, that
prooved to pull too much of my time away from rewriting artifact so I had to
drop out. However, my experience there and with the WASM folks has been nothing
but positive. Its been said before and I'll say it again: Rust has a great
community!

There is still much work to be done for artifact. For one thing I need to
figure out how to run `cargo-web` in CI for mac and windows so that I can
distrubute artifact for those platforms. I also need to finish end to end
testing (including using frontend testing using rust, more on that later!).

However, one of the primary distractions over the last several months has
been interviewing at Google... and the distractions paid off! I will be
starting as a Test Engineer at Google working on [Android
Auto](http://fortune.com/2018/05/07/volvo-google-assistant-cars/). This is
super exciting, but will not leave a lot of time for working on artifact.
Therefore this blog post is basically also a notice that I will be on haitus
for the next several months as I get up to speed on everything Googly.

If you find artifact valuable, please leave
[feedback](https://vitiral.github.io/artifact/docs/Feedback.html). Help
in maintaining it would also be much appreciated :).
