I've been having an idea for a space universe banging around in my head for a while, and I think it is time I finally put the ideas into writing, and potentially into a book.
This blog post will be a constantly changing overview of the world that the book will be set in.

# Overview

Year         : Jan 15th 2150
Solar System : ours
Singularity  : not even close

## Notable Technological Inventions/Advancements since 2015:
- inexpensive production of carbon nanotubes
    - tower to space
    - thin film microcomputers
        - very high computational efficiency and speed (nano-tubes are essentially superconductors)
        - brain embedded computers that use body heat for energy exist
    - low-cost, high strength materials for:
        - space vessels that are light and can withstand high-speed space debris
- Energy production
    - cheap high efficiency, high strength, solar cells
        - made from carbon nanotubes
            - good for survivability in space
        - provides nearly limitless energy to other technologies (i.e. hydrogen jets)
    - hydrogen fuel cells (in cars and as long term energy storage)
    - supercapacitors nearing the energy density of lithium ion
    - biochemical energy cells:
        - harvests glucose in the blood to provide small amounts of electricity
        - allows for implanted electronics and computers
        - uses a high density super capacitor to account for glucose fluctuations
    - continuous nuclear fusion
        - Still requires very large reactors
        - only gain 10% of the energy put in (10% efficiency)
        - remains very difficult problem to "perfect"
        - very rarely used on earth, mostly used in space when too far from the sun to harvest
            solar energy
    - Carbon nanotube wire
        - Carbon nanotubes are extremely resilient and nearly superconductive, making them the perfect
            energy transmission wire
- Computation:
    - low speed (2 GHz, 4 core) thin-film brain chip computers implanted in most "professionals"
        - mostly provides communication with external electronics, as well as helpful computations
            (math, memory aid, etc)
        - bio-chemically powered
    - thousand(s) core personal computers operating at terrahertz speeds
        - carried with person, similar to smart phone.
        - use carbon nanotubes for high efficiency/speed
    - Screens are still the most common way to visualize information
        - pure text-based (or sound based) information can be transmitted directly to the brain,
            however, sending visuals has been determined to be dangerous, annoying and potentially
            painful and has been discontinued. The exception is for enhancements like:
            - allowing the blind to see
            - temporarily enhancing the color spectrum for technicians so they can (for example) see x-rays, gama-rays
                or infrared
        - However, some forms of entertainment break this rule and attempt to provide a
            "real interactive digital experience" (RIDE). Different govermnets regulate this differently, in some nations
            it is illegal
- Communications:
    - cheap high power, high efficiency, almost perfectly focused lasers
        - not high power enough to be used as a weapon (although more expensive lasers can be)
        - necessary for high speed (but obviously high latency) communications in space
    - Ultra high speed carbon nanotube data link
        - carbon nanotubes are able to send a single photon (or electron) directly down their length, providing
            almost no loss and ultra-high speed. Used in everything from micro-electronics to global communications
    - Ultra low power wireless communication
        - communication can occur directly between people's brain chips as well as between any
            device within 1 mile. Provides an almost psychic connection with the electronics and people near a person
- Propulsion
    - terestrial propulsion:
        - [hyperloop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop)
            - now goes several times the speed of sound for continental transportation
        - hydrogen jets. Hydrogen can now be harvested using solar energy, and the hydrogen jet's only
            waste product is water (no polution)
            - generally used to only transport goods, people tend to take the hyperloop
        - self driving cars
        - tower to space
    - Inter-space Propulsion
        - Ion Engines
            - come in variety of sizes -- the largest ones provide reasonable thrust (about 100x more than their 2015 brothers)
            - Very small ones are possible on tiny robots or human transport ships of various efficincies.
            - practically the only engine in space as they are "fast enough" and extremely efficient.
        - Hydrogen Pulse Engine:
            - essentially fuses hydrogen to provide thrust. Somewhat dangerous to vessels nearby. Almost exclusively
                used on military vessels and for emergency propulsion systems on Stations
        - Hydrogen Jets
            - almost never used in space due to the wastefullness. Some (older) miliary vessels use them for emergency alignment
- Knowledge / Science
    - ultra high power particle accelerator
        - could only ever exist in space
        - larger in diameter than the entire earth
        - uses enough energy to warp the earth's magnetic field
    - massively advanced telescopes and general understanding of the universe
    - electro - biology, including the ability to be controlled by and communicate with the brain
    - medicine:
        - nano-technology cures destroying almost any parasite/bacteria/virus
        - ultra high focused resonance imaging capable of imaging individual molecules in the human body to bolster understanding
        - implanted sensors and electronics to detect abnormalities and report them to be treated extremely early

## Cultural changes
- space exploration:
    - the tower to space and other technological changes noted above have allowed people to live and work in space
    - Almost 2 billion people live in space as of 2150
    - Industries
        - asteroid mining for elements including carbon, hydrogen+oxygen, nitrogen, rare-earth metals.
            - most metals are not used as widely. Exceptions are things like titanium which are used in reactors and for certain structural
                elements. Metalurgy has created some very light and strong alloys, but nothing is even close to the strength of carbon
                nanotubes, restriction metal use to mostly high-heat applications
        - manufacturing:
            - space ships / stations
            - computers / electronics
            - pretty much anything. Primarily focused on space-related industries due to the high growth in space population
                The 0G environment makes producing many items much cheaper in space than on earth.
        - research / science
            - exploration (research stations orbiting or on Mars, Titan, Jupiter, etc)
- (on earth) self-driving car:
    - very few people own a car. "Taxis" are self-driving and incredibly cheap
    - public transporation (primarily train) has become the dominant form of transporation,
        with self-driving taxis suplimenting it
