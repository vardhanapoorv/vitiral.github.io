I've been having an idea for a space universe banging around in my head for a while, and I think it is time I finally put the ideas into writing, and potentially into a book.
This blog post will be a constantly changing overview of the world that the book will be set in.

# Overview

Year         : Jan 15th 2150
Solar System : ours
Singularity  : not even close

## Notable Technological Inventions/Advancements since 2015:
- inexpensive production of carbon nanotubes
    - tower to space
    - thin film microcomputers
        - very high computational efficiency and speed (nano-tubes are essentially superconductors)
        - brain embedded computers that use body heat for energy exist
    - low-cost, high strength materials for:
        - space vessels that are light and can withstand high-speed space debris
- Energy production
    - cheap high efficiency, high strength, solar cells
        - made from carbon nanotubes
            - good for survivability in space
        - provides nearly limitless energy to other technologies (i.e. hydrogen jets)
    - hydrogen fuel cells (in cars and as long term energy storage)
    - supercapacitors nearing the energy density of lithium ion
    - biochemical energy cells:
        - harvests glucose in the blood to provide small amounts of electricity
        - allows for implanted electronics and computers
        - uses a high density super capacitor to account for glucose fluctuations
    - continuous nuclear fusion
        - Still requires very large reactors
        - only gain 10% of the energy put in (10% efficiency)
        - remains very difficult problem to "perfect"
        - very rarely used on earth, mostly used in space when too far from the sun to harvest
            solar energy
    - Carbon nanotube wire
        - Carbon nanotubes are extremely resilient and nearly superconductive, making them the perfect
            energy transmission wire
- Computation:
    - low speed (2 GHz, 4 core) thin-film brain chip computers implanted in most "professionals"
        - mostly provides communication with external electronics, as well as helpful computations
            (math, memory aid, etc)
        - bio-chemically powered
    - thousand(s) core personal computers operating at terrahertz speeds
        - carried with person, similar to smart phone.
        - use carbon nanotubes for high efficiency/speed
    - Screens are still the most common way to visualize information
        - pure text-based (or sound based) information can be transmitted directly to the brain,
            however, sending visuals has been determined to be dangerous, annoying and potentially
            painful and has been discontinued. The exception is for enhancements like:
            - allowing the blind to see
            - temporarily enhancing the color spectrum for technicians so they can (for example) see x-rays, gama-rays
                or infrared
        - However, some forms of entertainment break this rule and attempt to provide a
            "real interactive digital experience" (RIDE). Different govermnets regulate this differently, in some nations
            it is illegal
- Communications:
    - cheap high power, high efficiency, almost perfectly focused lasers
        - not high power enough to be used as a weapon (although more expensive lasers can be)
        - necessary for high speed (but obviously high latency) communications in space
    - Ultra high speed carbon nanotube data link
        - carbon nanotubes are able to send a single photon (or electron) directly down their length, providing
            almost no loss and ultra-high speed. Used in everything from micro-electronics to global communications
    - Ultra low power wireless communication
        - communication can occur directly between people's brain chips as well as between any
            device within 1 mile. Provides an almost psychic connection with the electronics and people near a person
- Propulsion
    - terestrial propulsion:
        - [hyperloop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop)
            - now goes several times the speed of sound for continental transportation
        - hydrogen jets. Hydrogen can now be harvested using solar energy, and the hydrogen jet's only
            waste product is water (no polution)
            - generally used to only transport goods, people tend to take the hyperloop
        - self driving cars
        - tower to space
    - Inter-space Propulsion
        - Ion Engines
            - come in variety of sizes -- the largest ones provide reasonable thrust (about 100x more than their 2015 brothers)
            - Very small ones are possible on tiny robots or human transport ships of various efficincies.
            - practically the only engine in space as they are "fast enough" and extremely efficient.
        - Hydrogen Pulse Engine:
            - essentially fuses hydrogen to provide thrust. Somewhat dangerous to vessels nearby. Almost exclusively
                used on military vessels and for emergency propulsion systems on Stations
        - Hydrogen Jets
            - almost never used in space due to the wastefullness. Some (older) miliary vessels use them for emergency alignment
- Knowledge / Science
    - ultra high power particle accelerator
        - could only ever exist in space
        - larger in diameter than the entire earth
        - uses enough energy to warp the earth's magnetic field
    - massively advanced telescopes and general understanding of the universe
    - electro - biology, including the ability to be controlled by and communicate with the brain
    - medicine:
        - nano-technology cures destroying almost any parasite/bacteria/virus
        - ultra high focused resonance imaging capable of imaging individual molecules in the human body to bolster understanding
        - implanted sensors and electronics to detect abnormalities and report them to be treated extremely early
- Food production:
    - robotics and machine learning have allowed for automated food production
    - (on earth) permaculture and advanced farming techniques (i.e. using automated robots) have managed to significantly
        boost environmentally friendly food production. No chemicals are now used, instead biomater is harvested robotically or
        by using amimals and distributed automatically
    - "verticle farms" have advanced signiciantly and exist on earth and in space. They account for more than 70% of all food in
        cities and almost 95% of food in space.
    - animal protein sources have been almost phased out in favor of fermented and minimally processed plant based protein. The last 125
        years have created highly delicious and nutritionally complete plant-based calorie sources that are generally preferred to meat.
- Environmental
    - A huge number of specie's dna was preseverd in a massive effort during the great extinction (see below)
    - the effort has been underway for more than 30 years study and computationally model the environment prior to the extinction,
        to try and rebuild it
    - there has been some success in brining back the "primary" plants and animals to begin to refresh our environment. However,
        the complexity of the problem has been admitted to be "huge" and will advancement will be slow.
    - Because of advances in efficiency (partly driven by space living), modern humans are almost entirely 0 environmental footprint -- so
        at least they are not harming the environment they live in any more.
- Gravity
    - The only "artifical gravity" is centrifugal force (spinning a disk around). That's all. Seriously, Sci-Fi has ridiculous
        expectations on aritificial gravity. Not only is it widely available in most sci-fi, it also seems to work when there
        is absolutely no power or only life-support is functioning.

## Cultural changes
- space exploration:
    - the tower to space and other technological changes noted above have allowed people to live and work in space
    - Almost 2 billion people live in space as of 2150
    - Industries
        - asteroid mining for elements including carbon, hydrogen+oxygen, nitrogen, rare-earth metals.
            - most metals are not used as widely. Exceptions are things like titanium which are used in reactors and for certain structural
                elements. Metalurgy has created some very light and strong alloys, but nothing is even close to the strength of carbon
                nanotubes, restriction metal use to mostly high-heat applications
        - manufacturing:
            - space ships / stations
            - computers / electronics
            - pretty much anything. Primarily focused on space-related industries due to the high growth in space population
                The 0G environment makes producing many items much cheaper in space than on earth.
        - research / science
            - exploration (research stations orbiting or on Mars, Titan, Jupiter, etc)
- (on earth) self-driving car:
    - very few people own a car. "Taxis" are self-driving and incredibly cheap
    - public transporation (primarily train) has become the dominant form of transporation,
        with self-driving taxis suplimenting it
- (on earth) 2093 Environmental Collapse:
    - "Spiraling extinction rate" of all of earth's species
    - lead to 80% extinction rate
    - primary cause was human food production and pollution
    - human population was 11 billion in 2100 (it had reached a peak of 13 billion in 2075). Over-fishing and farming lead to
        massive environmental collapse in the food chain and in necessary insects and animals
    - environmental collapse was almost entirely blamed on animal protein sources, so they became extremely scarce for 25+ years.
        A massive private and governmental undertaking was done to overhaul the entire world's food production system and heavily
        regulate it to be in line with scientifically environmental principles
    - Climate change:
        - long running process that lead to "water wars" in 2055, massive drought and slow destruction of species.
        - An entire section of the north atlantic ice sheet came disconnected from the north pole in 2093, causing ocean levels to rise
            to unprecedented levels. This forced billions from their homes on coastal regions and creatd the largest number of refugees
            in human history
        - Several rain forests have flooded, several have been turned to desert. Several grassland/deserts have flooded for over
            20 years, having the effective climate of a rain forest.
    - Effect on human population:
        - The 2093 crisis affected many things:
            - coastal and island regions were heavily flooded
            - mass starvation with a death toll of 5 billion people
        - prior to the water wars (2055), there were about 100 million people in space.
        - In 2060, there were more than 150 million in space (8 billion on earth), with the IPGB ramping up production of stations,
            expecting a mass migration
        - In 2093 there were 1 billion in space (11 billion on earth)
        - In 2096 there were 2 billion in space (5.5 billion on earth). This was possible because of the massive production in habitation
            stations that had been underway for decades by they IPGB
        - In 2150 there are 3 billion in space and 5 billion on earth. Space population is expanding (but not rapidly), and earth population
            is about steady
    - Land:
        - bee and other polinators are almost completely extinct, destroying most 2015 crops and many plant species
        - farming and hunting killed off most natural grazers, destroying the prarie and brush-forests
        - Climate change:
            - A massive effort was launched in 2030 to preserve the rainforests, however massive climate change flooded them or turned them
                into desert, destroying a huge percentage of the earth's diversity
            - the already weak praries quickly turned to desert when a 25 year drought struck in 2050-2075 through most of the world
    - Ocean
        - Large ocean mamals were destroyed
        - Reefs were decimated
        - A majority of the ocean's fish species were destroyed. All large ocean creatures are now extinct except for those held in zoos.
    - As of 2050, the environment is turning around.
        - The near infinite energy of cheap high efficiency solar cells has enabled many efforts to be successful.
        - 98% of polution has been drained from the oceans using high-energy filters and micro-bacterial consumers
        - Nearly all plastics have been destroyed through a genetically modified bacteria designed to consume it.
        - Reclamation efforts have managed to restore about 30 reefs, requiring re-cloneing more than 30,000 variets of ocean life.
        - Greenhouse gases and air polution have been harvested from the atmosphere
        - Landfills and other trash sites have been harvested for the now valuable carbon and other minerals
        - Ultra-high regulation prevents any industry from poluting in any way
            - Significantly enhanced by research into space industries, as they do not allow waste for different reasons
        - It should be noted that technology that already existed in 2015 could have easily been used to nearly almost completely avoid the
            collapse. The fact that 2115 technology could begin to reverse the environmental collapse is mostly luck on our part
            - includes 2015 technology like permaculture, solar, elimation of high waste consumer goods and public transporation
            - but that isn't what this book is about...
 - Political changes:
    - very little has actually changed except for high regulations and crushing penalties concerning environmental damage (see above)
    - Power changes:
        - The US had lost a significant amount of miliaary and political power.
        - Power approximately equally split between the continents (North America, South America, Asia, Europe+Russsia (allies), Africa+Australia (allies))
        - Standard of living is almost equal throughout the world.
        - The IPGB controlls almost all of space, except for the area around the earth. It only controlls 1/4 of the moon
        - The power balance between earth+space is maintained by treaty and millitary force. There is tension, but it has never broke out
            in war.
    - standard of living took a horendous dive in the 2093 environmental collapse.
        - By 2093, most of the world would have been considered nearly 1st world (by 2015 standards).
        - after collapse, billions of people would have starved to death if not for immediate massive reforms and the sudden availability of
            migration to space (had begun in 2073, space tower in 2060)
        - an immediate end to nearly all animal agriculture and the fast creation of verticle farms in space and on earth along with strict
            population controls barely managed to provide enough calories to the population
- 2093 space migration
    - more than 1 billion people migrated to space between 2093 and 2100 (population before 2093 was 350 million)
    - most governments implemented strict population controls that are still in effect. However, this was not true for the newly formed
        IPGB (Interplanetary Governing Body), which encouraged reproduction
    - The IPGB implemented a nearly communist government, with an extremely high standard of living and technology. This encouraged
        many people to migrate from earth to space.
